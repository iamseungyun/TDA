    "Recall that given an object $X$, say a point cloud embedded in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, one can compute its persistence diagram $\\mathrm{Dgm}(X)$ which is a point cloud supported on a half-plane $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ (see this tutorial https://github.com/GUDHI/TDA-tutorial/blob/master/Tuto-GUDHI-persistence-diagrams.ipynb for an introduction to persistence diagrams).\n",

Here, we will consider that it consists of $n$ points sampled _i.i.d_ with respect to some law $\\xi$, thus denoted as $\\mathbb{X}_n = \\{X_1 \\cdots X_n\\}$, with $X_i \\sim \\xi$. To a *random* realization of $\\mathbb{X}_n$ corresponds a *random* persistence diagram. What can be said about this object? Can it be turn into a deterministic topological descriptor?\n",
